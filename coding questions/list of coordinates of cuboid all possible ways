learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a
 cuboid along with an integer 
. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, 
. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.


x=int(input("enter x:"))
y=int(input())
z=int(input())
n=int(input())
coordinates=[]
for i in range(x+1):
    for j in range(y+1):
        for k in range(z+1):
            if(i+j+k)!=n:
                coordinates.append([i,j,k])
print(coordinates)

x=int(input("enter x:"))
y=int(input())
l=[[m,n] for m in range(x+1) for n in range(y+1)]
print(l)
